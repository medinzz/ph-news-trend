# Philippine News Crawler and Trend Analyzer

## Overview

This project is a news crawler designed to gather and analyze the latest news information from various sources in the Philippines. By employing keyword analysis, the project aims to identify trending topics and keywords over time, offering valuable insights into public discourse and supporting informed decision-making.

## Current Status

The project is currently under development. The following milestones have been reached:

-   ~~**Crawler for Inquirer.net:** A functional crawler has been implemented to extract news articles from [inquirer.net](https://www.inquirer.net/).~~


-   **Integration of the following news outlets using their API**
    -   [ABS-CBN News](https://od2-content-api.abs-cbn.com/prod/latest?sectionId=nation&brand=OD&partner=imp-01&limit=8&offset=undefined) 
    -   [Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts)
    -   **Inquier** - Inquirer has different subdomains for their WP API:
        - [newsinfo](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/wp-json/wp/v2/posts)
        - [globalnation](https://globalnation.inquirer.net/wp-json/wp/v2/posts)
        - [business](https://business.inquirer.net/wp-json/wp/v2/posts)

        - [pop](https://pop.inquirer.net/wp-json/wp/v2/posts)
-   **Integration of Multiple Sources (In Progress):** Work is underway to incorporate additional news sources, including:
    -   [Manila Bulletin](https://mb.com.ph/api/pb/fetch-articles-paginated?limit=4&hide_widget_in_pagination=1&page=100&section_id=25) - API 
        - the parameter: `page` is only at 100 max.
        - limit can be exploited to increase the articles returned. But, takes a lot of time.



## Planned Features

The next major phase of development will focus on:

-   **Keyword Analysis:** Implementing algorithms and techniques to identify significant keywords and track their frequency over time.
-   **Trend Identification:** Analyzing the keyword data to discover emerging and declining trends in Philippine news.
-   **Data Visualization:** Creating visual representations (e.g., charts, graphs) to effectively communicate the identified trends and insights.
-   **Support for More News Sources:** Expanding the crawler to include a wider range of reputable Philippine news outlets.

## Potential Applications

The insights generated by this project can be valuable for:

-   **Journalists and Researchers:** Understanding the evolving news landscape and identifying key areas of public interest.
-   **Policymakers:** Gaining insights into public discourse surrounding important issues.
-   **Businesses and Organizations:** Monitoring public sentiment and identifying emerging trends relevant to their operations.
